# Code derived from Exercise 5.9.1
# Python For Everyone ~ Charles Severence

# Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the
# user enters 'done'. Once 'done' is entered, print out the total, count,
# and the average of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a
# number, detect their mistake using try and except and print an error
# message and skip to the next number.


num = 0
tot = 0.0
while True :
    sval = input("Enter a number: ")
    if sval == "done":
        break
    try:
        fval = float(sval);
    except:
        print("Invalid input")
        continue
    num = num +1
    tot = tot + fval
print(tot,num,tot/num)
